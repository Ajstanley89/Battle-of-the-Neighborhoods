# Toronto Neighborhood Analysis
Diversity defines the largest cluster of Toronto postal codes. These areas typically have access to wide varieties of restaurants and entertainment options. These areas tend to be clustered towards the harbor. There seems to be a lot going on in these areas, and it doesn't seem like one type of venue defines these places. Anecdotally, it seems seafood and sushi restaurants are more highly reccomended closer to the waterfront, and while this makes intuitive sense, there was no correlation observed in the clustering.

Park access defines the next clearest cluster of Toronto neighborhoods. Geographically, these areas are still in the middle of Toronto, but they probably ahve parks within them. It's possible that people in thes areas prefer the parks to other venues, beacause the parks were the only consistently reccomended venue in this cluster.

There also seems to be a cluster defined by convenience and discount stores. I'm not sure if these areas would be the nicest to visit.

Away from the heart of the city, we start seeing some differnt characteristics in neighborhoods. Foursquare seems to have fewer reccomendations for these areas, so the options seem more limited. For instance, one of these clusters is solely defined by fast food, while another cluster is solely defined by a piano bar.
